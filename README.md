# 4-Bit ALU VHDL Repository

## Overview

This repository contains the VHDL code for a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The ALU is capable of performing a variety of arithmetic and logic operations on 4-bit binary numbers. This implementation is designed as a learning tool for understanding basic digital design principles and VHDL programming.

### Features

- **4-Bit Addition**: Performs binary addition of two 4-bit numbers.
- **Complement**: Calculates the binary complement of a 4-bit number.
- **Decrement**: Decreases a 4-bit number by 1.
- **Increment**: Increases a 4-bit number by 1.
- **Left-Rotate**: Rotates a 4-bit number to the left.
- **Left Shift**: Shifts a 4-bit number one bit to the left.
- **Right Rotate**: Rotates a 4-bit number to the right.
- **Subtraction**: Performs binary subtraction of two 4-bit numbers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A VHDL simulator (e.g., ModelSim, GHDL) for running and testing the code.
- (Optional) FPGA board for hardware implementation.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/arda-kara/ALU-vhdl]
```

### Running the Simulation

1. Open your VHDL simulator.
2. Load the ALU VHDL files from the repository.
3. Run the simulation according to your simulator's instructions.
4. (Optional) Modify testbenches for custom tests.

### Implementing on FPGA

- Follow your FPGA board's specific guidelines for implementing VHDL code.
